# 🏗 Game Explorer - Architecture Documentation

## 📖 Overview

Game Explorer is built with **React** and **Vite**, leveraging **Firebase** for authentication and **RAWG.io API** for fetching game data. The application follows a **component-based architecture** with React Context for state management.

## 🔄 Data Flow & State Management

- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user login/logout.
- **React Context**: Used for global state management (wishlist, search, theme preferences).
- **RAWG.io API**: Fetches game details, recommendations, and trending games.
- **Custom Hooks (`useGames.ts`)**: Handles API calls and data transformation.

## 🔌 External Services

- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure login/logout.
- **Firestore (Optional)**: For storing user preferences (wishlist, liked games).
- **RAWG.io API**: Provides game-related data.

## 🔍 Component Interactions

```
[ App.tsx ]
    ├── [ Header.tsx ] ➝ Handles navigation and authentication UI.
    ├── [ GameList.tsx ] ➝ Fetches and displays game cards.
    ├── [ GameDetails.tsx ] ➝ Shows details when a game is selected.
    ├── [ Wishlist.tsx ] ➝ Stores user’s favorite games.
```

## 🛠 Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep API calls in `services/`, state in `context/`.
- **Reusability**: Use reusable UI components to keep code DRY.
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimize page performance with dynamic imports.
- **Error Handling**: Use try-catch in API calls to handle failures gracefully.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Implement **Redux Toolkit** for scalable state management.
- Add **SSR with Next.js** for better SEO.
- Improve caching strategies for faster loading times.
